# Performance Report Generator

This script generates a detailed performance report for a system and a tested game, including metrics such as GPU usage, CPU usage, RAM usage, and frame rates. It parses data from a metrics file, creates visual plots, and compiles the information into a Word document.

## Features

Parses performance metrics from a specified file.\
Generates individual and comparative plots for performance metrics.\
Compiles the preset system details and game details as well as metrics, and plots into a Word document.\
Highlights key performance results such as minimum and maximum frame rates, GPU, and CPU usage.

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

### Required Python libraries
pandas\
matplotlib\
python-docx\
numpy

### Input File
The script expects a file named menu_gameplay.hml in the same directory as the script.\
This file should contain performance metrics generated by MSI Afterburner.

## Setup and Usage

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Install the required libraries using the following command:\
pip install pandas matplotlib python-docx numpy

### Step 2: Place Metrics File
Ensure the menu_gameplay.hml file is in the same directory as the script.

### Step 3: Run the Script
Execute the script by running:\
python report_gen.py

### Step 4: View the Output
The generated report will be saved as Performance report.docx in the script's directory.\
Plots will be saved in a plots directory created in the script's directory.

## Script Details

### Inputs
System Details: Embedded in the script as a multi-line string.\
Game Details: Embedded in the script as a multi-line string.\
Metrics File: menu_gameplay.hml.

### Outputs
Word Document Report: Contains system details, game details, key results, and plots.\
Plots: Visual representations of metrics saved as PNG files.

## Key Metrics

The script analyzes the following metrics:\
GPU1 temperature (°C)\
GPU1 usage (%)\
CPU temperature (°C)\
CPU usage (%)\
RAM usage (MB)\
Frame rate (FPS)\
HDD usage (%)\
Network download rate (MB/s)

## Plot Intervals

The script generates plots for the following intervals:\
Entire duration (menu + gameplay).\
Menu phase (first 25 seconds).\
Gameplay phase (100 to 300 seconds).\

## Notes

If the menu_gameplay.hml file is missing, the script will raise a FileNotFoundError.\
Ensure the data file adheres to the expected format for successful parsing.
